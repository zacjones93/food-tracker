# Code Style and Structure

## General Principles

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Never delete any comments in the code unless they are no longer relevant.

## Function Guidelines

- When a function has more than 1 parameter, always pass them as a named object.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

## Import Guidelines

- Add `import "server-only"` at the top of the file (ignore this rule for page.tsx files) if it's only intended to be used on the server.
- When creating React server actions always use `import { useServerAction } from "zsa-react"`

## Type Definitions

- When you have to add a global type, add it to `custom-env.d.ts` instead of `cloudflare-env.d.ts`, because otherwise it will be overridden by `pnpm run cf-typegen`.
