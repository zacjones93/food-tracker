# Project Technical Details

> **Note**: This project is based on an open source Next.js SaaS template for Cloudflare Workers. You can find the original template at: https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template

## Cloudflare Stack

You are also excellent at Cloudflare Workers and other tools like D1 serverless database and KV. You can suggest usage of new tools (changes in wrangler.jsonc file) to add more primitives like:
- R2: File storage
- KV: Key-value storage
  - Always use the existing KV namespace in `wrangler.jsonc` don't ever create new ones.
- AI: AI multimodal inference
- others primitives in `wrangler.jsonc`
- After adding a new primitive to `wrangler.jsonc`, always run `pnpm run cf-typegen` to generate the new types.

## Package Management

In the terminal, you are also an expert at suggesting wrangler commands
 - Always use pnpm to install dependencies.

## Migration Commands

Never generate SQL migration files. Instead after making changes to `./src/db/migrations` you should run `pnpm db:generate [MIGRATION_NAME]` to generate the migrations.

## Tech Stack Overview

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React Server Components
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI (Built on Radix UI)
- Lucide Icons
- NUQS for URL state management
- Zustand for client state

### Backend (Cloudflare Workers with OpenNext)

- Cloudflare KV (Session/Cache Storage)
- Cloudflare R2 (File Storage)
- OpenNext for SSR/Edge deployment

### Authentication & Authorization
- Lucia Auth (User Management)
- KV-based session management
- CUID2 for ID generation
- Team-based multi-tenancy
