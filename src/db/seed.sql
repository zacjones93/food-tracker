- _4 Tbsp_ [_coconut oil_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ALGGHS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thewestonapri-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B002ALGGHS&linkId=4c86ab5fa76071a303aa3723eb59a003)
- _2 shallots or 1 small onion, peeled and thinly sliced_
- _1/4 tsp unrefined sea salt_
- _2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_
- _1 red chili, chopped finely_
- _5 spring onions or scallions, chopped_
- _5 pastured eggs_

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Soak rice in warm water mixture for at least 7 hours. Bring to a boil, skim, reduce heat, cover tightly and cook over low heat for 45 minutes.
2. After 45 minutes, take the lid off and spread out the rice onto a tray. Leave to cool, uncovered for 20-30 minutes (until room temperature).
3. Heat 1 Tbsp of the oil in a large wok or frying pan until hot. Add shallots or onion, and cook for 5-6 minutes until browned and crispy, then remove from the pan and place in a bowl.
4. Turn the heat down to medium and add another 1 tbsp of oil to the wok and add garlic and chili. Heat for one minute until fragrant. Now add the rice to the wok and cook on a high heat. Use a spatula to ensure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan, and move the rice around so that it’s all getting reheated.
5. Once the rice is hot (this will take about 5 minutes), push the rice over to the side of the pan and crack one of the eggs into the space. Making sure this bit of the pan is over the heat, fry the egg, giving a mix with the spatula until the egg starts to cook and look scrambled.
6. Now mix the egg into the rice. Add the spring onions or scallions, a pinch of salt and the crispy shallots/onion and mix it all together. Reduce the heat to low.
7. Add the remaining oil to a large frying pan and heat until hot, then fry the remaining four eggs until the white is crisp at the edges, but the yolk is still runny (You can baste the egg in the hot oil to make it cook quicker).
8. Divide the rice between four bowls and top each with a fried egg, and serve.

- 1-2 Shallots, diced
- 1.5-2 tbsp of [**Homemade Chilli Oil**](https://tiffycooks.com/spicy-wontons-ft-best-chili-oil/)
- 2 tbsp of [**Soy Sauce**](https://amzn.to/3j6dOFP)

- 1 tbsp of Crushed Red Chilli Flakes
- 1 tbsp of Sesame Seeds

-

- 6-8 cloves of Garlic minced

-

- 1/4 Cup Cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1-2 Limes

-

- 4 tbsp of Oil
- 1 tsp of Sichuan Pepper Corn

### Chicken Marinade: 


(All- Purpose Stir Fry Sauce - we normally have the sauce on hand so you don''t need to use the entire batch just to marinate the chicken)

- 1/2 Cup Fresh Orange Juice
- 1 Cup Soy Sauce
- 2 Tbsp. Rice Vinegar
- 1/4 Cup Fish Sauce
- 2 tsp. Garlic Powder
- 2 tsp. Ginger Powder
- 1 tsp. Sesame Oil (optional)

## How to Make:

- Marinate the chicken in the all-purpose stir fry sauce for a few hours up to 24 hours in advance.
- In a bowl, add in 2 tbsp of Soy sauce, 3 tbsp of Black Vinegar, 1.5-2 tbsp of Homemade Chilli Oil, Crushed Red Chilli Flakes, Sesame Seeds, diced shallots
- Mince the garlic and set aside in another small bowl for now
- Chop up your cilantro and lime juice and place In another separate small bowl. (You will add this in to the sauce at the end.)
- First Cook the chicken in the marinade until done. While the chicken is cooking heat up your water that you will cook the noodles in (make sure to salt your water).
- Once the chicken is done, heat 4 tbsp of oil and once the oil is hot add in 1 tsp of Sichuan Peppercorn for a few minutes.
- Next place a spoon with the minced garlic in the first bowl you made with the soy sauce, black vinegar, etc.
- Pour the hot oil over the garlic and make sure to strain the oil so the peppercorn doesn’t go in. Let the oil sizzle and mix. Then add in the cilantro and lime juice to the sauce.
- Cook the sourdough noodles in the boiling water for 90 seconds or until soft and chewy (this could take a little longer).
- Drain the noodles and then add the sauce into the noodles. Serve with the chicken. You can also add in cucumber, green onion, fried egg, and/or cilantro.

Pork:


• ⅔ pound pork tenderloin
• 2 tablespoons coconut amimos
• 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
• Pinch of ground white pepper
(optional)


Soup: 
• 2 tablespoons avocado oil
• 5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
• 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger
• 6 scallions, chopped and separated into white and green parts
• Salt
• 2 to 2½ cups finely sliced carrot (cut into matchsticks)
• 8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced
• 2 to 2½ cups chicken stock
• 1 tablespoon coconut aminos
• Hot red pepper sauce (such as A&B American-Style Pepper Sauce) (optional)
• 2 tablespoons cider vinegar (or rice vinegar for milder taste)
• 2 large eggs (see note on following page)
• 1½ tablespoons arrowroot or tapioca starch
• Pinch of ground white pepper


Note: 
To form fluffy eggs, the
broth needs to come
to a rolling boil. If the
temperature of the broth
is not hot enough, it will
not form fluffy eggs. If
you can''t have eggs, skip
this step and thicken
the soup with only the
arrowroot slurry (see
step 5).

1. PREPARE THE PORK: Slice the pork tenderloin into thin
strips, place in a bowl, and season with the remaining pork
ingredients. Mix well and set aside in the refrigerator.
2. PREPARE THE SOUP: Heat a heavy-bottomed soup
pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add the
avocado oil. Sauté the garlic, ginger, and white scallion
parts until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Season with a pinch
of salt. Add the seasoned pork. Season with another pinch
of salt and sauté until the pork is no longer pink. Add the
sliced carrot and shiitake mushrooms. Season with another
pinch of salt and sauté for about 1 minute.
3. Add the chicken stock, cover, and bring to a simmer over
medium heat. Season with the coconut aminos, hot pepper
sauce to taste, if using, and cider vinegar. Give it a gentle
stir, then adjust the seasoning to taste (perhaps more
coconut aminos, vinegar, salt, white pepper, or hot sauce).
Bring the soup to a boil and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, as the soup comes to a boil, whisk the eggs in
a bowl. When the broth is boiling, turn off the heat. Hold
chopsticks or a fork against one side of the bowl. From
that side, slowly drizzle the eggs into the boiling soup in a
swirling motion. Let the eggs stand for a few seconds to take shape in the boiling soup, and then gently whisk the
broth and eggs to finish cooking,
5. Prepare a slurry of the arrowroot starch and 3 tablespoons
cold water in a separate bowl. To thicken the soup, turn the
heat back on and bring the soup to a simmer (not boiling).
Give the arrowroot slurry another stir, then slowly drizzle it
in. Gently whisk and let the broth simmer for about 1 minute,
then turn off the heat. (If the slurry is overheated, the
texture will break down.) Garnish with the green scallion
parts and a pinch of white pepper, if desired. Serve hot and
immediatelv.

# _**instructions for using a whole chicken**_


Break the chicken* down into smaller pieces, so that the surface area of the joints will contact the water. Include feet and neck, 1 or 2 as the minimum, and more if you have them. Place pieces in the dutch oven, add one qt water per every 1lb meaty bone. Add chopped carrots and onions (optional) & 1 tbsp sea salt to the pot. Bring to a boil, keep boiling for 15 minutes. Skim any “impurities” that have risen to the top. This looks like brown foam. Bring to a simmer and cover for 1.5- 2 hours. The more you skim, the clearer the consistency of the stock.


Next, remove the chicken. If you would like, place it in a bath of ice water. An ice bath will stop the cooking immediately and allow you to take the shredded chicken off the bone more quickly. Otherwise, it will be too hot to touch, and you’ll have to wait for about 30-45 minutes.


If you pour the hot stock into your glass jars, this will sterilize the jar, and the meat stock will be good for 7-10 days in your fridge.


If you want to turn your meat stock into soup: Add your vegetables: onions, carrots, mushroom, radish, broccoli (no stems), cauliflower (no stems), and bring to a simmer for 45 minutes. Add some chicken (you will likely have leftovers for salad or stirfries), skin, and “nibbly bits”. Add in any additional meat, egg yolks, and salt to taste.


It is good in the freezer for up to 1 year and the fridge for about one


week.*I leave the breasts out of the stock, and save them for frying at a later time.

- 2 tbsp Sriracha

### **Instructions**

- In a bowl, add all the ingredients for the marinade and save about 1/4 cup for basting in a separate bowl.
- Now add your chicken to the marinade and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
- The next day, preheat the grill to 350 degrees and place the chicken opposite of the heat so they don’t burn. Once the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165, give them a sear on both sides. About 2 minutes per side or until they are nicely charred.
- Place them back on the indirect heat and baste with that reserve marinade. Leave on the grill for an additional 10 minutes, ( this will help the sauce to set)
- Pull them off once they reach an internal temperature of 175. Garnish with parsley or green onion.
- Let cool for 3 min before serving.

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 pound french green beans with ends removed
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup water

**Place a wide skillet with a lid on the stove. Put the green beans in the pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Dot the butter over top and pour in the water. Add the lid and turn to medium low heat. Let the green beans steam until just tender, about 8 minutes. Remove the lid and let the water evaporate and the green beans brown just a bit in the butter giving a stir every so often. Taste for seasoning and serve warm!**

Simple Seasons April 2025 Catalog


Ingredients: 

- 2 pounds baby red potatoes, quartered

Dressing:

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- a handful of chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, whatever you have!)
- 1 garlic clove, finely minced
- 1-2 teaspoons dijon mustard
- fresh black pepper to taste

Place the potatoes in a large pot and just cover with water. 


Put it over medium heat and boil until the potatoes are just tender. This should take about 7-8 minutes once it comes to a boil. 


You don’t want them to turn to mush so keep an eye out and poke them with a knife or fork every few minutes to check on them. 


Drain the water and let them sit. Don‘t rinse them, but let them steam dry as they cool a bit.


While they are cooling, mix the dressing ingredients in a large bowl and whisk your little heart out until it all comes together. 


Add the potatoes to the bowl and gently toss to coat. This is excellent at room temperature as well as warm, so it’s ok if you make it a bit ahead of time ;) Enjoy!

Ingredients:

- [ ] bone in chicken thighs 
- [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 2 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 4-5 minced garlic cloves
- [ ]  the zest and juice of 1 large lemon
- [ ] two very generous pinches salt, pepper
- [ ] 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 
- [ ] 1 tbsp oregano, 
- [ ] 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

Sauce

- [ ] 3tbsp thick greek yogurt (or labneh), 
- [ ] a handful fresh mint (3 tbsp), 
- [ ] 2 scallions, 
- [ ] 1/2 large jalapeño, 
- [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil, 
- [ ] the juice of half a lemon,
- [ ]  a couple generous pinches of salt + pepper. 

 


1.Add 4 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs to a bowl. Dab dry with a paper towel.


.


2.Grab a medium mixing bowl to make the marinade. Add 3 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 4-5 minced garlic cloves, the zest and juice of 1 large lemon, two very generous pinches salt, pepper, 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp oregano, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Mix very well.


3.Add marinade to the chicken and massage into the chicken, covering all sides. Let this soak up the flavors for 2-6hrs, but ideally overnight.


.


4.When you’re ready to eat, remove chicken from fridge and let it come up to room temp before putting in the oven.


.


5.Place chicken on a wire rack pop into the oven at 425F for 37-40 mins. Or 400F for 40-45 mins. I prefer the higher heat.


6.While thats going, make your sauce. I processed 3tbsp thick greek yogurt (or labneh), a handful fresh mint (3 tbsp), 2 scallions, 1/2 large jalapeño, 1 tbsp olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, and a couple generous pinches of salt + pepper. Process well, taste, and adjust to your liking.


.


7.Plate up your chicken, and serve however way you wish. It goes amazing with regular rice, quinoa, or if you’re lowcarb/keto my high protein kaizen rice along with a simple cucumber salad and lots of sauce.

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- a couple generous pinches salt

## Cucumber salad

- 2 persian cucumbers
- cubing 1 small avocado
- finely dicing 1/4 of a small red onion (about 3 tbsp of onion)
- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt, pepper.

1. Preheat oven to 425F.


.


2.Thinly slice 1 red onion and place slices at the base of an oven-safe dish. Grab 4 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, dab them dry with a paper towel and add them on top of the sliced onions in the oven-safe dish. Let chicken come up to room temp while you work the sauce in the next step.


.


3.For the sauce paste, grab a medium mixing bowl. Add the juice of 1 large lemon, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 2 tbsp olive oil, a couple generous pinches salt, pepper, 1 tbsp sweet paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp oregano, 1 tbsp sumac. Mix really well.


.


4.Brush the sauce paste all over the chicken, covering all sides. Reserve some of it for later.


.


5.Put the chicken in for an initial 35 minute visit in the oven at 425F. At 35 minutes remove the chicken, brush with the remaining sauce paste, and put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes.


.


6.Make the cucumber avocado salad by finely dicing 2 persian cucumbers, cubing 1 small avocado, finely dicing 1/4 of a small red onion (about 3 tbsp of onion), 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper. Give it a mix, taste, and adjust. You can also add lemon juice to this, but I left it out since the chicken was lemony enough.


.


7.Remove the chicken from the oven, plate it up with the salad to serve and top with some sumac or chile lime seasoning. Again, you can serve this with whatever base you like (it would be delicious with regular rice, quinoa, or if you’re lowcarb/keto my high protein kaizen rice with just 6 net carbs a serving!)


.


ENJOY!

### **Instant Pot**


I am absolutely in love with my Instant Pot. Here is how to make bone broth in your Instant Pot:

1. Place your bones in the Instant Pot. Add apple cider vinegar, and salt. If you are adding veggies, do it now.
2. Add water until the pot is ⅔ full.
3. Select the "Manual" for 120 minutes. (I actually decrease the time because the timer resets at 120 after you decrease to zero.)
4. Once the cooking is complete, press "Cancel" and then use the natural pressure release - you can also use the quick release method - either works.
5. Strain the broth and pour it into jars. Store in the fridge.

Ingredients
• 2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
• 5 green onions, thinly sliced
• 5 large celery stalks, 1/4-inch dice
• 2 garlic cloves, minced or grated
• 2 tsp. finely minced rosemary
• 2 tsp. finely minced thyme
• Salt and pepper, to taste
• 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (preferably organic)
• 10 cups bone broth, such as Smart Chicken organic bone broth
• 3 bay leaves
• 4 medium carrots, washed and 1/4-inch dice
• 8 ounces wide spiral-cut egg noodles
• 1 tbsp. minced flat leaf parsley



Directions: 
• Bring a large dutch oven or soup pot up to heat over medium. Add in the EVOO, green onion, celery and garlic. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until fragrant and the veggies begin to soften. Next add in the rosemary and thyme and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Liberally season with salt and pepper.
• Next add in the chicken, bone broth and bay leaves. Stir, bring to a simmer then cover, reduce to low and cook for 45 minutes.
• After 45 minutes remove the thighs and shred using 2 forks or tongs. At this point it should shred easily. Turn to medium heat, remove the bay leaves then add the chicken back in along with the carrots. Cook for 10 minutes then add in the pasta and cook for 10 minutes more or until the pasta is tender. Stir occasionally.
• Lastly stir in the parsley and taste for seasoning. Ladle into shallow bowls and serve.

Ingredients:

- 2.5lbs Chicken Thighs
- 2-3 tbsp. Olive Oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- 2 tbsp yogurt
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 tbsp thyme
- 1.5 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp. smoked paprika
- 1/2 tbsp Aleppo pepper (look for sub)
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp. tumeric
- 1/2 tsp. cumin
- 1/4 tsp. cardamom
- 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp. nutmeg
- 1/2 large red onion

1.Start with 2.5 lbs of boneless chicken thighs. Trim off any excess fat to the extent you’d like. Add it to a bowl.


.


2.Season the chicken well. Add 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, 3-4 pinches of salt, fresh cracked pepper, 2 tbsp of plain yogurt, the juice of 1/2 large lemon. Then add 1 tbsp thyme, 1.5 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tbsp Aleppo pepper, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg. These seasonings are ideal, but if you don’t have cardamom or nutmeg, its all good! Feel free to adjust to your liking.


.


3. Mix it super well, then thinly slice 1/2 large red onion and mix it in with the chicken. You ideally let this marinate for 2-6 hours, but even better overnight, but if you want to make it right away, you can.


.


4.When you’re ready to make it, remove the chicken from the fridge and let it come up to room temp (about 30 mins). Preheat your oven to 425F then pack the marinated chicken tightly into a bread loaf pan (about 8.5x4.5x2.5). Pop it into the oven for 45-55 mins at 425F.


.


5.Remove the chicken from the oven, tilt the pan over a glass bowl or container to pour out the excess juices (save the juice to use as broth or to pour over the chicken).


.


6.Flip the loaf pan onto a cutting board to remove the chicken and cut it into thin slices or strips.


.


7.Serve it up however way you want - as is, on top of a salad, on a power bowl, whatever! This stays well in the fridge in an airtight lid for 4-5 days.

- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp herb seasoning
- ½ stick of butter (1/4 of a stick or less to cut down - or tallow)
- 4 small golden potatoes cut into fries

### **Instructions**

- Start off by cutting up your potatoes, you can always buy them in a bag. I used my potato slicer. Par boil the fries for 5 minutes, then let them cool and pat dry.
- Now season those up (use your favorite seasoning) and set aside. The steaks, cube them up into 1/2 inch cubes.
- Now season those up with your favorite seasoning. Once everything is prepped, preheat your skillet to medium high heat. Now add about 2 tbsp cooking oil to the pan and start to sear your steak bites
- Sear about 1 minute per side or until they are nicely browned. Remove them and set aside.
- In the same skillet, add the fries, give them a good crisp. This is about 4 minutes.
- Now remove those and cut the heat to low. Add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the garlic.
- Once the garlic is fragrant, add the herb seasoning.
- Once all is incorporated, add the steak bites and potatoes to the skillet. Combine until everything is coated nicely. Remove from heat, let cool for 5 min before serving.

- 1 bunch of cilantro
- 7 garlic of cloves
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp paprika powder
- ½ cup avocado oil (sub olive oil)
- juice of 3 limes

### **Instructions**

- Start off by making the marinade. In a food processor, throw in all the ingredients for the marinade and blend until smooth. Then, set it aside.
- Butterfly the drumsticks open. Lay them flat on a cutting board and run your knife along the thickest part, slicing until the bone is exposed. (You want to just open them up.
- Once you do this to all of them, season them with salt and then place in a bowl. Set aside and preheat your grill to 350 degrees.
- Cook the chicken about 3 minutes per side until you get a nice char. They will look a bit funny with no marinade. Once they are nicely charred and not burnt, baste with that marinade on one side. Then, flip them after 3 min and baste the other side.
- Remove the chicken once it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees. Let cool for 3 min before serving.

## ingredients

- medium Yukon Gold potatoes
- 4 tablespoons (½ stick)
- unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## instructions


1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.

1. Using a knife, slice each potato crosswise into thin slices, taking care not to cut all the way through. (For even slicing, you can lay 2 wooden spoons or chopsticks along the sides of the potatoes as guides. This keeps the knife from cutting all the way through.)
2. Place the potatoes in a 9 × 13-inch or 7 × 11-inch baking dish and use your hands to carefully fan the potatoes out.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.
4. Spoon the butter mixture over each potato, making sure to get in the cuts and coat the potatoes well, about 1 tablespoon per potato.
5. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes. Sprinkle the Parmesan and parsley evenly over each potato. Return to the oven and bake until the Parmesan is melted and a little crispy, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.

Makes 4 to 6 servings

- 8 slices (½ inch thick) rustic white bread, such as sourdough
- 4 tablespoons (½ stick) butter, melted
- margherita
    - 2large heirloom tomatoes or

## instructions

1. Heat a large skillet or panini press over medium-low heat.
2. Rub the raw garlic clove over both sides of the bread and lightly brush the bread with the melted butter.
3. To make the margherita version: Layer 4 slices of the bread with the tomatoes, then the mozzarella. Season with salt and pepper to taste and top with the basil leaves. Lightly drizzle with olive oil and top with the remaining 4 slices of bread.
4. To make the turkey and roasted pepper version: Spread ½ tablespoon of the pesto on each of 4 slices of bread. Layer on the turkey, roasted peppers, and cheese and top with the remaining 4 slices of bread.

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

### **Instructions**

- Prep the Ingredients
- Cut steak into 2-3" pieces. Rub evenly with avocado oil then season well on all sides with blackened seasoning. Allow steak to sit for 10-15 minutes at room temp to remove the chill from the fridge while preparing potatoes.
- Peel potatoes and quarter them. Place them in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes to remove the excess starch. Drain, then place them in a pot of salted water and boil them until fork tender while you cook steak.
- Cook Steak and Potatoes
- In a large skillet over medium-high heat 2-3 tablespoons avocado oil and add in steak pieces in the hot skillet (you may need to cook in batches to avoid overcrowding).Cook them undisturbed about 2 minutes, or until they have a good golden coloring. Flip just once. Continue to cook 1 minute, then reduce heat to low and cook 1 minute. Remove steak and place in a bowl.
- Add in 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and saute in the butter until fragrant in the same pan. Toss the steak in the garlic butter, tossing to coat on all sides, cooking another minute. Remove steak and place in a bowl, tented with foil to keep moist.
- Make the Cream Sauce & Serve
    - In the same pan with residual butter and garlic, add two more 2 tablespoons of butter and remaining minced garlic. Saute until fragrant. Slowly whisk in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer, allowing it to reduce for 3-5 minutes.
- Meanwhile, drain water from potatoes and add in the melted butter, cream and mash until no longer chunky. Add in the cheese, seasonings and mix until smooth.
- Into the sauce, add in red pepper flakes and scallions then the parmesan cheese. Whisk until the sauce thickens and taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Serve by plating the steak over the potatoes and spooning over the parmesan cream sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cassava flour
- 3 tablespoons arrowroot powder
- ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup palm shortening or Ghee (393)
- 1 egg
- 3 to 4 tablespoons cold water

## Directions 


In a food processor, add the cassava flour, arrowroot powder, and salt. Pulse to combine. Add the palm shortening or ghee and pulse until incorporated and the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Add the egg and pulse until combined. Add the water a tablespoon at a time until the dough starts to come together and is not too sticky. Dust your hands with cassava flour and form the dough into a ball.
Place it on a flat, floured surface or a piece of parchment paper. Dust the dough with more cassava flour, flatten the dough into a disc, and place another piece of parchment paper on top. Roll the dough into a circle about ¼-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a pie plate, press it into place, and crimp the edges. Poke the bottom a few times with a fork. Fill and bake the crust as indicated in the pie recipe. To pre-bake the crust for use in recipes that do not require further baking, bake in a 350 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
Make it Ahead: If you are not using the dough right away, it can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for a few days.

Ingredients: 

- 2 lbs. chicken thighs
- 1.5 tbsp. EVOO
- 1 tbsp. smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp. garlic powder
- 1 tbsp. thyme
- 1/2 tbsp chili flakes
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
- salt & pepper
- 2 tbsp. yogurt + 1/4 cup for dressing
- Juice of 2 lemons (1 for chicken + 1 for salad)
- 1 red onion
- handful cherry tomatoes
- parsley
- 2 tbsp. sumac (sub. lemon zest, lemon pepper, lemon juice, or vinegar)
- 1/4 cup pickle juice
- 2 dill pickles
- Rice

1.Add 2 lbs chicken thighs to a bowl. Drizzle with 1.5 tbsp EVOO and season with 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsb thyme, 1/2 tbsp chili flakes, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, a few pinches salt & ground pepper, 2 tbsp plain yogurt, & juice of 1 lemon. Mix well, then ideally let this marinate for 4-6hrs, but if you want to make it right away go ahead.


.


2.When you’re ready to eat, bring a pan to medium heat, add 1 tbsp oil, add the chicken (brought up to room temp before cooking), and cook it through on medium heat. I used a cast iron pan and cooked on each side for 4 mins, then cooked on each side for about 1-2 minutes again. This takes about 10-12 mins depending on thickness.


.


3.Make the salad by thinly slicing a large red onion, a small handful of cherry tomatoes, a large handful of fresh flat parsley. Add to a bowl, sprinkle with 2-3 pinches salt, 2 tbsp of sumac, & juice of 1 large lemon. Mix well, then let it sit for about 10 mins, stirring it a couple of times.


.


4. Make the white sauce by mixing 1/4 cup plain yogurt, 3 tbsp mayo, 1/8 to 1/4 cup pickle juice, 2 tbsp fresh dill, a small pinch salt, & lots of fresh cracked pepper. Mix well, taste, & adjust.


.


5.Finally, get your base ready. To keep this lowcarb, I used my Kaizen lowcarb rice (just 6 net carbs + 20g protein per serving), but you can use regular rice too!


.


6.When rice is cooked, add a serving to the bowl, some chicken, then pile it high with the salad, some sliced Persian cucumbers, fresh herbs, and drizzle it up with the white sauce.

Ingredients:

- 1 lb ground beef (80–85% lean works well)
- ½ medium onion, finely grated (about ¼ cup, with juice)
- 2–3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped (or 1 tsp dried mint)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- ¾ tsp sea salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- Optional: pinch of chili flakes for heat
- Optional: 1 tbsp olive oil (if mixture is too lean/dry)
- Bamboo or metal skewers

### Instructions:

1. Prepare the meat mixture:
    - In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, grated onion (with juice), garlic, herbs, and spices.
    - Mix gently with your hands or a fork until everything is well distributed. Don’t overmix or it may become tough.
2. Form the kebabs:
    - Divide the mixture into 6–8 portions.
    - With damp hands, shape each portion into a long oval or log shape around a skewer (about 5–6 inches long).
    - If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes beforehand to prevent burning.
3. Chill (optional but helpful):
    - Place formed skewers on a plate and refrigerate for 15–30 minutes to help them hold their shape on the grill.
4. Grill:
    - Preheat grill to medium-high.
    - Oil the grill grates or brush kebabs lightly with oil to prevent sticking.
    - Grill for about 3–5 minutes per side, rotating to brown all sides, until cooked through and nicely charred.
5. Serve:
    - Great with cucumber yogurt sauce (tzatziki), grilled veggies, or wrapped in lettuce or gluten-free flatbread.
    - A side of lemony cucumber salad or grilled zucchini is perfect!

Taken from Histamine Reset Plan (pg 133) + Twist from ChatGPT


### Ingredients

- 1 lb grass-fed ground beef or turkey
- 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh oregano (up from ½ tbsp)
- ½ tsp sea salt (adjust to taste)
- 2 tbsp grass-fed butter or ghee
- 2 cups green cabbage, finely sliced
- 1 cup Brussels sprouts, shredded
- 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ tsp ground coriander (bright, citrusy, and generally low-histamine)
- ½ tsp ground ginger (fresh ginger also works well if preferred)
- Optional: 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or cilantro for topping

### Instructions

1. In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cook the beef, oregano, coriander, and ¼ tsp of salt for about 10 minutes or until fully browned. Remove from pan and set aside.
2. Wipe out the skillet and return it to the heat. Melt the butter, then add the onion and Brussels sprouts. Sauté for 5 minutes.
3. Add the cabbage, garlic, ginger, lemon zest, remaining ¼ tsp salt, and a splash of water if needed to deglaze. Stir frequently and cook for another 5–6 minutes until everything is soft and slightly golden.
4. Stir in the beef and warm through for 1–2 minutes. Top with parsley or cilantro and serve.

### Flavor Tips Without Histamine Triggers

- Add fresh basil or thyme for more aromatic layers.
- Use cold-pressed flaxseed oil drizzled at the end for a nutty finish.

**Preparation**


_Prepare the Za''atar Seasoning:_ In a small bowl, mix the dried oregano (1 Tbsp), sesame seeds (1 Tbsp), ground sumac (2 tsp), and dried thyme (1 tsp) until well combined.


Set aside for seasoning the chicken.


_Prepare the Chicken:_ Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). In a large bowl, toss the chicken drumsticks (6 drumsticks) with melted butter (2 Tbsp), the homemade za''atar blend, garlic powder (½ tsp), smoked paprika (½ tsp), sea salt (½ tsp), and black pepper (¼ tsp) until evenly coated. Place the drumsticks on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Roast for 35–40 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).


_Prepare the Cucumber Herb Slaw:_ While the chicken roasts, place the julienned cucumber (1 cup), sliced red onion (¼ cup), chopped parsley (2 Tbsp), and chopped mint (2 Tbsp) in a bowl. Drizzle with lemon juice (1 Tbsp) and olive oil (1 Tbsp). Season with sea salt (¼ tsp) and black pepper (¼ tsp). Toss gently to combine and chill until ready to serve.


_Assemble the Dish:_ Serve the crispy za''atar chicken drumsticks hot with a generous side of cucumber herb slaw. Drizzle extra olive oil over the slaw or add a squeeze of fresh lemon if desired.

### **Curry**

- 3 tbsp[ ](https://www.teaforturmeric.com/recommends/avocado-oil/)**oil**
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 (~220 g) medium onion, _finely chopped_
- 5-6 garlic cloves, _crushed or very finely chopped_
- 1- inch piece ginger, _crushed or very finely chopped_
- 1 lb ground beef, _See Note 1_
- 1 medium (2 small/~250 g) ripe tomato, _finely chopped – See Note 2_
- 1-2 green chili peppers (such as a small Serrano or Thai chili), _chopped_
- 1 tbsp plain whole-milk yogurt
- 1 tsp [**ground coriander (or coriander powder)**](https://www.teaforturmeric.com/coriander-powder-ground-coriander/)
- 3/4 tsp mild red chili powder, _or to taste_
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 1/8 tsp kosher salt, _or to taste_

### **After cooking**

- 1 cup (~130 g) frozen green peas, _thawed_
- 1 small mild green chili pepper (such as a Serrano), _chopped – optional_
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4-1/2 tsp [**garam masala**](https://www.teaforturmeric.com/garam-masala-recipe/), _start with 1/4 tsp if using store-bought_
- 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, _chopped, plus more for garnish_
- 1/2 tsp fresh lemon or lime juice, _or serve with lemon/lime wedges_

### Instructions

- Heat oil in a medium-sized pan over high heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds and onion and sauté until the onions are golden brown, about 8 minutes.
- Add the garlic and ginger and stir for a minute, until aromatic. Add the ground beef and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until it’s no longer pink and most of the moisture dries up. Use a wooden spatula to break up the meat into small pieces to ensure no lumps.
- Add the tomato, green chili pepper, yogurt, coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric, and salt and continue to sauté for 2 minutes, until the tomatoes start to break down. You’ll notice the liquid in the mixture is beginning to come to a boil. Add 1/4 cup water and allow it to come to a simmer again.
- Lower the heat to medium, cover and allow it to cook for 15 minutes, stirring once in between. If you feel that there is not enough moisture and the meat is sticking to the bottom of the pan, add another 1/4 cup water.
- Uncover, and stir in the peas, more green chili pepper (if using), and 1/2 cup water. Cover again and allow the mixture to cook for 3-5 minutes, or until the peas are cooked through. (See Note 3)
- Add the black pepper, garam masala, and cilantro and sauté for another minute or two, until you can see the oil separating from the curry. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Lower the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and allow the flavors to settle for 5 minutes.
- Turn off the heat, sprinkle with more cilantro and squeeze in lemon or lime juice. Serve hot with any kind of bread (roti, naan, sliced bread), or rice.

### Notes


**Note 1:**


Lean and full-fat (20%) both work, though lean is a bit more dry. Feel free to use ground chicken, lamb, or other ground meat.


**Note 2:**


If you use a [**food processor**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LBZOYAK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=teaforturmeri-20&linkId=e639b1f9840dccfc019ecc90b9952253&language=en_US) to chop the tomatoes like I do, it’ll most likely break them down and release enough water to cook the keema. If you’re using Roma tomatoes or other tomatoes with less water quantity, you may have to add up to 1/2 cup water before the meat cooking process.


**Note 3:**


Cook time varies depending on how thawed the peas are. If you forgot to thaw as I often do, cook for about 7 minutes. You want them to maintain shape and not entirely shrivel up, but also break easily when pressed between your fingers.

INGREDIENTS


Brownies:


1 cup sugar


1 cup butter (melted)


2 eggs


3 tbsp lemon juice 


1.5 cups flour


1/4 tsp baking powder


Icing:


1 cup powdered sugar


~2 tbsp lemon juice


DIRECTIONS


1. Mix all the wet ingredients and sugar until well combined, make sure the butter is not too hot or else it will curdle the eggs.


2. Add in the flour and baking powder and mix until just combined. Then pour batter into a greased (or lined with parchment paper) baking tray.


3. Bake at 350F for 20-30 minutes. If you like it to be more fudgy, slightly underbake the brownies, or until when you stick a toothpick in the center and take it out, there are crumbs still stuck to the toothpick (but not wet batter). If you like it to be more cake-like, bake for a longer time, or until when you stick a toothpick in the center and take it out, there are no crumbs stuck to the toothpick.


4. Let the brownies cool down completely. In the meantime, make the icing by combining powdered sugar with lemon juice. Add the juice a little bit at a time, and mix until you get the consistency you like.


5. Once the brownies have cooled, pour the icing sugar over the top. Enjoy immediately, or let it sit for 30-60 min to soak up some of the icing for a softer consistency!

<u>Ingredients</u>

- 1/2 cup almond butter (I used Trader Joe''s mixed nut butter - so good!)
- 2 tbsp pure maple syrup
- 1 tbsp melted coconut oil/ butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Sprinkle of ground cinnamon
- Pinch of sea salt
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup chocolate chips (or mini chocolate chips!)
- _Makes 16 cookie dough balls._
1. Combine all ingredients except almond flour and chocolate chips in your food processor. Process until smooth and combined. You can also mix it by hand in a medium bowl.
2. Add the almond flour and process again until well combined.
3. Add the chocolate chips process once more for a few seconds - you still want the chips to have some texture.
4. Use a spoon or a small cookie scoop to scoop out the dough and roll it into balls about the size of a tablespoon. You can add a few extra chocolate chips on the outside once they''re rolled to make them extra cute.
5. Place the cookie dough balls on a plate and freeze for 10 minutes. Then move into the fridge and store there for a quick grab-and-go to satisfy that sweet tooth.

Ingredients: 


3 lbs bone in skin on chicken thighs and/or drumsticks
1 tsp salt
2 tsp paprika
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp black pepper
2-3 tbsp olive oil
½ yellow onion, thinly sliced
6-8 sprigs fresh thyme
2 cups chicken bone broth
2 tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch
Cooked white rice, for serving


Instructions: 


Preheat oven to 350°F. Add chicken to roasting dish and
season with salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder,
oregano and black pepper. Drizzle with olive oil then toss
well until evenly coated.
Add onions and thyme then pour bone broth into your pan.
Avoid pouring it directly over the chicken so that the
seasonings do not come off of the chicken.
Cover and bake for 1 hour 30 minutes.
Remove chicken from the oven and discard the sprigs of
thyme. Pour as much of the broth into a separate bowl as
possible and set chicken aside.
Increase oven temperature to 450°F.
Add ¼ cup chicken drippings to a small bowl along with
arrowroot and whisk until smooth to make a slurry. Whisk the
slurry into the bowl with the rest of your chicken drippings
then pour the gravy over your chicken and toss well until
evenly coated.
Return the chicken to the oven uncovered for 20 minutes
longer, basting every 5 minutes (optional) until golden brown
and gravy has thickened.
Serve over rice.

1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. Start with 3lbs beef chuck roast and add it to an oven safe dish. You''ll want one with a lid, or cover it for the first portion. Add 1 thinly sliced yellow onion at the base.
3. Season both sides of beef with 3-4 generous pinches salt, pepper, 1 packet of taco seasoning. Rub well on all sides. oth, pop it

5. Cover, then place in the oven at 325F for 4 hours. If yours is more than 3lb aim for about an hour per pound + 1 hour. So if its 2lbs go for 3 hours, or in this case 3 los, go for 4.
6. After 4hrs, remove the chuck roast from the oven, shred using two forks, mix well with the drippings, then put back in the oven at 400F for 30-40 mins.
Shred again when you remove from the oven. gotta try making this

**Servings**: 4


**Prep Time**: 10 min


**Cook Time**: 25 min


**Total Time**: 35 min


### **Ingredients**:

- 1 lb ground beef (grass-fed if you prefer)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium potatoes, diced (or use sweet potatoes for extra nutrients)
- 1 bell pepper, diced (any color)
- 1 zucchini, diced (optional for extra veg)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil or beef tallow
- 4 eggs (optional, for serving)
- Fresh parsley or green onions for garnish

---


### **Instructions**:

1. **Prep potatoes**:

    If using regular potatoes, dice them small and optionally parboil them for 5 minutes to soften. This step speeds up cooking.

2. **Cook the beef**:

    In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink (about 6–8 minutes). Remove and set aside. Drain excess fat if needed.

3. **Sauté veggies**:

    In the same pan, heat olive oil or tallow. Add diced potatoes and cook until starting to brown (8–10 minutes). Add onion and bell pepper, and cook until soft, another 5 minutes. Add zucchini last if using.

4. **Season**:

    Stir in garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

5. **Combine**:

    Add the cooked beef back to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook together for a few more minutes to blend flavors.

6. **Top with eggs (optional)**:

    Make 4 small wells in the hash and crack an egg into each. Cover and cook on low until eggs are set to your liking (about 5 minutes for runny yolks).

7. **Garnish and serve**:

    Top with chopped parsley or green onions. Serve hot!

Ingredients for the Crust:

- 1 cup (100 g) blanched almond flour
- ¼ cup (30 g) tapioca flour
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup (57 g) cold salted butter, cut
into small pieces

Ingredients for the Filling:


- 2 tablespoons (28 g) salted butter
- 1  medium y ellow onion. diced
- 3-4 medium carrots, diced
- 3-4 stalks celery, diced
- 1 pound (454 g) or more precooked
chicken , diced
- 2 cups (330 g) frozen peas
- 1 cup (113 g) frozen green beans
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground mustard
- 4 teaspoon ground coriander
- ⅛ teaspoon chili powder
- ¾ teaspoon granulated garlic
- ¼ tsp onion powder
- Sea salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 cup (237 ml) chicken broth
or Bone Broth (page 149)
- 1 tablespoon (8 g) tapioca flour


Make the Crust:

1. In a food processor, add all the dry
ingredients. Process until combined.
Add the butter, egg, and water. Pulse
until mixed and a dough forms.
2. Scoop out the dough, and place it on
a piece of parchment paper. Store it in
the freezer for 30 minutes
1 large e88
3 tablespoons (44 ml) cold water
3. Place the chilled dough between two
sheets of parchment paper. Roll out the
dough to the size and shape of your pan
(l use a 9 x 13-inch [23 × 33-cm]), using
your pan as a mold or stencil.
4. Store the crust in the freezer until ready
to use.

Make the Filling:

1. In a 10-inch (25-cm) skillet, cook the
chicken and set aside. Using the same
pan, melt the butter. Add the onions
carrots, and celery, and sauté for about s
minutes until tender
2. Add the chicken, frozen veggies, and
seasonings. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until the veggies are thawed and soften.
3. Add the broth. Make a well in the middle
of the pan, then whisk in the tapioca flour
Stir to combine. It should become a nice
thick gravy consistency
Make the Potpie:
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
5. Spoon the filling into the pan. Place the
piece of dough on top; unlike some pot
pies, setting the dough on top is enough
here, and there is no need to pinch around
the edges to seal. Make three slots on the
top to vent.
6. Bake for 40 minutes. If you would like to
toast the crust, place it under the broiler
for the last couple minutes. But keep a
close eye to make sure it doesn''t burn.
7. Let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting
and serving to give it time to set back up
and hold together.
Note: This potpie is even more delicious with a
bottom crust as well! Simply double the dough
ingredients, and split it into two pieces before
rolling it out and placing it in the freezer. Use
some ghee, butter, or avocado oil to grease the
pan before laying one piece of the dough in
the bottom.

2 tbsp oil


1/2-314 cup heavy cream


Dough:

For Nutella:

- spread hazelnuts on pan and roast at 350 for 10 mins. Rub in paper towel to remove skins. Blend in food processor with oil until it makes a butter consistency.

- 1 teaspoon salt (6g)

### Egg wash (optional step)

- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon water
- sesame seeds (optional)

Instructions

1. In a stand mixer with a dough hook, add sourdough starter, warm water, all purpose flour, melted butter or coconut oil, honey, salt and egg. Knead for 5-10 minutes with dough hook until smooth and elastic.
2. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap for 8 hours.
3. Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill covered overnight.
4. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces.
5. Shape the buns by creating a flat surface on top and tucking the remaining dough underneath. I also like to create a little tension by rotating each bun slightly on a lightly floured surface.
6. Cover the buns with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and allow to rise until doubled.
7. Beat the egg yolk and water and brush the tops of the buns with the mixture.
8. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. (optional)
9. Bake the buns for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees. You want them to be golden on top.

Ingredients: 


**Kebabs:**

- 2 pounds chicken breast, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons dried italian seasonings
- 2 teaspoons saltpepper to taste

**Herbed Yogurt Sauce:**

- 1/4 cup parsley
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill
- big pinch of salt and pepper
- juice from half a lemon
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 cup full fat greek yogurt

**Yogurt Naan:**

- 2.5 cups einkorn flour (or whatever all purpose flour you have)
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup greek yogurt

Instructions:


**In a large bowl, toss the chicken cubes with the rest of the kebab ingredients. Let them marinate for up to 12 hours and at least 1 hour. About 30 minutes before cooking, thread the chicken on skewers. If you don’t want to use skewers, you can keep the chicken breasts whole and grill them that way. While they are coming to room temperature, mix all of the yogurt sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. Preheat your grill to medium heat and put the kebabs on. Close the grill and cook them for about 6 minutes on the first side. Flip them and cook for another 6 minutes or so. The chicken should be cooked through and have grill marks on it. Serve with sliced cucumbers, yogurt sauce, and the yogurt naan on the next page.**


**In a large bowl mix the flour, salt, and baking powder with a fork. Add the honey and greek yogurt and mix, mix, mix! Use your hand to knead the dough in the bowl until there is no flour left in the bottom. If it won’t come together, you can add a splash of water to help it form a ball. Cover it with a towel and let it rest for about 15 minutes while you heat up a large skillet over medium heat. You can use a stainless steel skillet, but I prefer to use my cast iron skillet or griddle. Cut the dough into 10 roughly equal pieces and roll them into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll them out as thinly as you can manage, about 1/4 inch thickness. It maybe helpful to put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper if you find it’s sticking. When you have a few rolled out, start cooking so you can alternate rolling and cooking at the same time. Just plop the flatbread onto the pan and let it cook for about 2 minutes on the first side, flip it and cook for another minute or two. Place it on a plate and cover it with a towel to keep warm. Repeat until they are all cooked and enjoy! We love ours with a bit of butter spread on and a sprinkle of salt.**

Ingredients:


Chicken Marinade:

- 1.5 lbs (680g) chicken thighs, boneless & skinless
- 3 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp seasoning salt
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 2 tbsp yogurt
- 2 tbsp olive oil

Garlic Parmesan Herb Butter:

- 1 stick butter (unsalted)
- 8 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup parmesan, grated
- 1 tbsp hot sauce (I used Frank’s)
- 2 tsp chili flakes
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped


Instructions:

1. If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them
in water for at least 15 minutes.
2. Cut your chicken thighs into large bite-sized
pieces. Mix all the marinade ingredients together
in a bowl with the chicken then toss to coat.
Marinate for as long as your patience can handle
- you can do one minute but vou can also do
overnight (the longer the better the flavor).
1. Preheat the air fryer to 375°F (190°C). 4. In a
large pan, melt 1 stick of butter then add in the
minced garlic. Cook for two minutes over
medium-low heat. Add in the grated parmesan,
hot sauce, chopped parsley and chili flakes. Mix
together for one minute then set aside.
2. Set aside 1/2 of the garlic butter, using the
other 1/2 to baste the chicken as it cooks.
3. Skewer the chicken and cook for 7-8 minutes
then baste with garlic butter and flip. Cook for
another 7-8 minutes, baste again with garlic
butter, and flip.
4. For extra crispy edges, increase the
temperature to 400°F (205°C) for the last 2-3
minutes.
5. Once the chicken is cooked through, let the
chicken rest for 5 minutes, then baste with the
reserved butter. Optionallv finish with more
parmesan and fresh parsley. Enjoy!

Ingredients:

- 3 TBS honey or maple
- 2 TBS lemon juice
- 4 TBS gelatin

Instructions:


Add the liquid to a medium-sized
saucepan, without heat on. Sprinkle gelatin
in a thin, evenly distributed layer on top
and let sit for a minute to bloom. Turn
stove on medium heat and slowly stir until
gelatin is completely dissolved. If you have
any gelatin clumps, use the back of a spoon
to flatten them out (if you have a lot, you
can blend the mixture on low). Turn off
heat and stir in remaining ingredients.


Pour into candy molds or a parchment
paper-lined baking dish (I use an 8x8, but
you can adjust size and have
thicker/thinner gummies) and allow to set
in fridge for 1-2 hours (you can use the
freezer for 15-20 minutes to speed up the
setting process). Serves 3.


** For strawberry or mango gummies, heat
fruit on the stove until simmering and soft.
Combine all ingredients in a blender and
blend until smooth. Pour into molds or a
parchment paper-lined baking dish and
allow to set in fridge. Serves 3.
