Once the chicken is done, heat 4 tbsp of oil and once the oil is hot add in 1 tsp of Sichuan Peppercorn for a few minutes. Next place a spoon with the minced garlic in the first bowl you made with the soy sauce, black vinegar, etc. Pour the hot oil over the garlic and make sure to strain the oil so the peppercorn doesn''t go in. Let the oil sizzle and mix. Then add in the cilantro and lime juice to the sauce. Cook the sourdough noodles in the boiling water for 90 seconds or until soft and chewy (this could take a little longer). Drain the noodles and then add the sauce into the noodles. Serve with the chicken. You can also add in cucumber, green onion, fried egg, and/or cilantro.', 1760731829780, 1760731829780, 0);

Next, remove the chicken. If you would like, place it in a bath of ice water. An ice bath will stop the cooking immediately and allow you to take the shredded chicken off the bone more quickly. Otherwise, it will be too hot to touch, and you''ll have to wait for about 30-45 minutes.
If you pour the hot stock into your glass jars, this will sterilize the jar, and the meat stock will be good for 7-10 days in your fridge.
If you want to turn your meat stock into soup: Add your vegetables: onions, carrots, mushroom, radish, broccoli (no stems), cauliflower (no stems), and bring to a simmer for 45 minutes. Add some chicken (you will likely have leftovers for salad or stirfries), skin, and "nibbly bits". Add in any additional meat, egg yolks, and salt to taste.
It is good in the freezer for up to 1 year and the fridge for about one week. Leave the breasts out of the stock and save them for frying at a later time.', 1760731829780, 1760731829780, 0);

3. For the sauce paste, grab a medium mixing bowl. Add the juice of 1 large lemon, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 2 tbsp olive oil, a couple generous pinches salt, pepper, 1 tbsp sweet paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp oregano, 1 tbsp sumac. Mix really well.
4. Brush the sauce paste all over the chicken, covering all sides. Reserve some of it for later.
5. Put the chicken in for an initial 35 minute visit in the oven at 425F. At 35 minutes remove the chicken, brush with the remaining sauce paste, and put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes.
6. Make the cucumber avocado salad by finely dicing 2 persian cucumbers, cubing 1 small avocado, finely dicing 1/4 of a small red onion (about 3 tbsp of onion), 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper. Give it a mix, taste, and adjust. You can also add lemon juice to this, but I left it out since the chicken was lemony enough.
7. Remove the chicken from the oven, plate it up with the salad to serve and top with some sumac or chile lime seasoning. Again, you can serve this with whatever base you like (it would be delicious with regular rice, quinoa, or if you''re lowcarb/keto my high protein kaizen rice with just 6 net carbs a serving!).

1. Saut√© (optional but adds flavor)
    - Set Instant Pot to Saut√© mode.
    - Add 1 tbsp olive oil or animal fat.
    - Sear chicken 2‚Äì3 minutes per side until lightly browned. Remove and set aside.
2. Saut√© aromatics
    - In the same pot, add onion (if using), garlic, ginger, and a pinch of salt. Saut√© 2‚Äì3 minutes until fragrant.
    - Press Cancel.
3. Deglaze
    - Pour in a splash of broth or water and use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom.
4. Add all ingredients
    - Layer in the root veggies, spices (turmeric, cinnamon, salt), apple cider vinegar, and remaining broth or water (about 4 cups).
    - Place seared chicken on top.
5. Pressure Cook
    - Lock the lid, set valve to Sealing.
    - Press Manual or Pressure Cook and set time for 15 minutes on High Pressure.
6. Natural Release
    - Let pressure release naturally for 10‚Äì15 minutes, then release the rest manually.

    - (Optional) Stir in a handful of chopped greens and let them wilt with the residual heat.
    - Add fresh herbs or a drizzle of flax/olive oil for an extra nutrient boost.
**‚úÖ Notes:**
- This recipe works great with fresh meat for lower histamine content.
- Store leftovers in glass containers and reheat gently (avoid long refrigeration if histamine-sensitive ‚Äî freeze if needed).
- For added gut support, stir in 1 tbsp collagen or gelatin powder before serving.', 1760731829781, 1760731829781, 0);

Process until you have a ground chicken mixture, then add 1/2 cup asiago or parmesan cheese and process again.
3. Grab a pizza pan or sheet pan, spray it with Avocado Oil Spray. Add your pizza "dough" and make a very thin layer of crust. I went with a few mini crusts, but you can make whatever size you like. Just make it as THIN AS POSSIBLE.
4. Bake for 13-15 minutes at 425F for mini crusts, or until golden crispy. Keep an eye on the oven as ovens vary. Remove from the oven.
5. To make the dressing, grab a mixing bowl. Add 3 tbsp Chosen Foods Avocado Oil Mayo, 3 tbsp thick plain greek yogurt, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, 1.5 tbsp apple cider vinegar, the juice of 1 lemon, 1 finely minced garlic clove, 3 finely diced anchovy filets (optional but so good), salt, lots of fresh cracked pepper, and 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese. Mix really well, taste & adjust. If the dressing is too thick, you can always thin it out with more lemon juice or a couple tbsp water.
6. Next, chop up 2 romaine lettuce, add the sauce, and toss.
7. Finally, remove crust from the oven, top with the salad, shredded parmesan, & fresh cracked pepper.

**Servings**: 4
**Prep Time**: 10 min
**Cook Time**: 25 min
**Total Time**: 35 min
### **Ingredients**:
- 1 lb ground beef (grass-fed if you prefer)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium potatoes, diced (or use sweet potatoes for extra nutrients)
- 1 bell pepper, diced (any color)
- 1 zucchini, diced (optional for extra veg)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ¬Ω tsp ground cumin
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil or beef tallow
- 4 eggs (optional, for serving)
- Fresh parsley or green onions for garnish
---
### **Instructions**:
1. **Prep potatoes**:
    If using regular potatoes, dice them small and optionally parboil them for 5 minutes to soften. This step speeds up cooking.
2. **Cook the beef**:
    In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink (about 6‚Äì8 minutes). Remove and set aside. Drain excess fat if needed.
3. **Saut√© veggies**:
    In the same pan, heat olive oil or tallow. Add diced potatoes and cook until starting to brown (8‚Äì10 minutes). Add onion and bell pepper, and cook until soft, another 5 minutes. Add zucchini last if using.
4. **Season**:
    Stir in garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook 1‚Äì2 minutes until fragrant.
5. **Combine**:
    Add the cooked beef back to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook together for a few more minutes to blend flavors.
6. **Top with eggs (optional)**:
    Make 4 small wells in the hash and crack an egg into each. Cover and cook on low until eggs are set to your liking (about 5 minutes for runny yolks).
7. **Garnish and serve**:
    Top with chopped parsley or green onions. Serve hot!

1. In a food processor, add all the dry ingredients. Process until combined. Add the butter, egg, and water. Pulse until mixed and a dough forms.
2. Scoop out the dough, and place it on a piece of parchment paper. Store it in the freezer for 30 minutes.
3. Place the chilled dough between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll out the dough to the size and shape of your pan (use a 9 x 13-inch pan), using your pan as a mold or stencil.
4. Store the crust in the freezer until ready to use.
Make the Filling:
1. In a 10-inch skillet, cook the chicken and set aside. Using the same pan, melt the butter. Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and saut√© for about 5 minutes until tender.
2. Add the chicken, frozen veggies, and seasonings. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are thawed and soften.
3. Add the broth. Make a well in the middle of the pan, then whisk in the tapioca flour. Stir to combine. It should become a nice thick gravy consistency.
Make the Potpie:
4. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).
5. Spoon the filling into the pan. Place the piece of dough on top; unlike some pot pies, setting the dough on top is enough here, and there is no need to pinch around the edges to seal. Make three slots on the top to vent.
6. Bake for 40 minutes. If you would like to toast the crust, place it under the broiler for the last couple minutes. But keep a close eye to make sure it doesn''t burn.
7. Let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting and serving to give it time to set back up and hold together.
Note: This potpie is even more delicious with a bottom crust as well! Simply double the dough ingredients, and split it into two pieces before rolling it out and placing it in the freezer. Use some ghee, butter, or avocado oil to grease the pan before laying one piece of the dough in the bottom.', 1760731829781, 1760731829781, 0);

While they are coming to room temperature, mix all of the yogurt sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside. Preheat your grill to medium heat and put the kebabs on. Close the grill and cook them for about 6 minutes on the first side. Flip them and cook for another 6 minutes or so. The chicken should be cooked through and have grill marks on it. Serve with sliced cucumbers, yogurt sauce, and the yogurt naan on the next page. In a large bowl mix the flour, salt, and baking powder with a fork. Add the honey and greek yogurt and mix, mix, mix! Use your hand to knead the dough in the bowl until there is no flour left in the bottom. If it won''t come together, you can add a splash of water to help it form a ball. Cover it with a towel and let it rest for about 15 minutes while you heat up a large skillet over medium heat. You can use a stainless steel skillet, but I prefer to use my cast iron skillet or griddle. Cut the dough into 10 roughly equal pieces and roll them into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll them out as thinly as you can manage, about 1/4 inch thickness. It maybe helpful to put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper if you find it''s sticking. When you have a few rolled out, start cooking so you can alternate rolling and cooking at the same time. Just plop the flatbread onto the pan and let it cook for about 2 minutes on the first side, flip it and cook for another minute or two. Place it on a plate and cover it with a towel to keep warm.

Ingredients: 
- 2 cups frozen strawberries
- 3 TBS honey or maple
- 2 TBS lemon juice
- 4 TBS gelatin
Instructions:
Add the liquid to a medium-sized
saucepan, without heat on. Sprinkle gelatin
in a thin, evenly distributed layer on top
and let sit for a minute to bloom. Turn
stove on medium heat and slowly stir until
gelatin is completely dissolved. If you have
any gelatin clumps, use the back of a spoon
to flatten them out (if you have a lot, you
can blend the mixture on low). Turn off
heat and stir in remaining ingredients.
Pour into candy molds or a parchment
paper-lined baking dish (I use an 8x8, but
you can adjust size and have
thicker/thinner gummies) and allow to set
in fridge for 1-2 hours (you can use the
freezer for 15-20 minutes to speed up the
setting process). Serves 3.
** For strawberry or mango gummies, heat
fruit on the stove until simmering and soft.
Combine all ingredients in a blender and
blend until smooth. Pour into molds or a
parchment paper-lined baking dish and
allow to set in fridge. Serves 3.
