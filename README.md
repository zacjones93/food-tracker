# Running it locally

4. `pnpm db:migrate:dev` - Creates a local SQLite database and applies migrations
5. `pnpm dev`
6.  Open http://localhost:3000

## Changes to wrangler.jsonc

After making a change to wrangler.jsonc, you need to run `pnpm cf-typegen` to generate the new types.

## Things to change and customize before deploying to production
1. Go to `src/constants.ts` and update it with your project details
2. Update `.cursor/rules/001-main-project-context.mdc` with your project specification so that Cursor AI can give you better suggestions
3. Update the footer in `src/components/footer.tsx` with your project details and links
4. Optional: Update the color palette in `src/app/globals.css`
5. Update the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your project details

## Deploying to Cloudflare with Github Actions

1. Create D1 and KV namespaces
2. Set either `RESEND_API_KEY` or `BREVO_API_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker depending on which email service you want to use.
3. Create a Turnstile catcha in your Cloudflare account, and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` as a Github Actions variable.
4. Set `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker.
5. Update the `wrangler.jsonc` file with the new database and KV namespaces, env variables and account id. Search for "cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template" recursively in the whole repository and change that to the name of your project. Don't forget that the name you choose at the top of the wrangler.jsonc should be the same as `services->[0]->service` in the same file.
6. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens and click on "Use template" next to "Edit Cloudflare Workers". On the next, page add the following permissions in addition to the ones from the template:

9. Optional: If you want clear the CDN cache on deploy, add `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` to the Github repository variables for the zone id of your domain. This is the zone id of your domain, not the account id.
10. Push to the main branch
