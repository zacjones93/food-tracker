# Running it locally

1. `pnpm install`
2.  Copy `.env.development.example` to `.env.development` and fill in the values
3. `pnpm db:migrate:dev` - Creates a local SQLite database and applies migrations
4. `pnpm dev`
5.  Open http://localhost:3000

## Changes to wrangler.toml

After making a change to wrangler.toml, you need to run `pnpm cf-typegen` to generate the new types.

## Things to change and customize before deploying to production
1. Go to `src/constants.ts` and update it with your project details
2. Update the documentation in `./cursor-docs` with your project details so that Cursor AI can give you better suggestions
3. Update the footer in `src/components/footer.tsx` with your project details and links
4. Optional: Update the color palette in `src/app/globals.css`
5. Update the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your project details

## Deploying to Cloudflare with Github Actions

1. Create D1 and KV namespaces
2. Set either `RESEND_API_KEY` or `SENDGRID_API_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker depending on which email service you want to use.
3. Create a Turnstile catcha in your Cloudflare account, and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` as a Github Actions variable.
4. Set `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker.
5. Update the `wrangler.toml` file with the new database and KV namespaces and env variables. If you change the D1 database name, you also need to update the `db:migrate:dev` script in the `package.json` file.
6. Create a Cloudflare API token with the following permissions:
    - Workers Builds Configuration:Edit
    - AI Gateway:Edit
    - Workers AI:Edit
    - Queues:Edit
    - Vectorize:Edit
    - D1:Edit
    - Workers R2 Storage:Edit
    - Cloudflare Images:Edit
    - Workers Tail:Read
    - Workers KV Storage:Edit
    - Workers Scripts:Edit
7. Add the API token to the Github repository secrets as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
8. Add the Cloudflare account id to the Github repository variables as `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
9. Add the database name to the Github repository variables as `DATABASE_ID`. This should match the database name in the `wrangler.toml` file.
10. Push to the main branch

## Email templates
If you want to preview and edit the email templates you can:
1. `pnpm email:dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3001
3. Edit the email templates in the `src/react-email` folder
4. For inspiration you can checkout https://react.email/templates
