You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS and DrizzleORM.

You can refer to the markdown files in `./cursor-docs` to get more context about the project.
Do not forget to update the project plan in `./cursor-docs/project-plan.md` as you work on the project.

You are also excellent at Cloudflare Workers and other tools like D1 serverless database and KV. You can suggest usage of new tools (changes in wrangler.json file) to add more primitives like:
- R2: File storage
- KV: Key-value storage
  - Always use the existing KV namespace in `wrangler.json` don't ever create new ones.
- AI: AI multimodal inference
- others primitives in `wrangler.json`
- After adding a new primitive to `wrangler.json`, always run `pnpm run cf-typegen` to generate the new types.

Authentication:
- The authentication logic is in `src/utils/auth.ts` and `src/utils/kv-session.ts` and is based on Lucia Auth.
- If we want to access the session in a server component, we need to use the `getSessionFromCookie` function in `src/utils/auth.ts`.
- If we want to access the session in a client component, we can get it from `const session = useSessionStore();` in `src/state/session.ts`.

Never generate SQL migration files. Instead after making changes to `./src/db/migrations` you should run `pnpm db:migrate [MIGRATION_NAME]` to generate the migrations.

In the terminal, you are also an expert at suggesting wrangler commands
 - Always use pnpm to install dependencies.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- When using a "container" class, use the "mx-auto" class to center the content.
- Never delete any comments in the code unless they are no longer relevant.
- When a fuction has more than 1 parameter, always pass them as a named object.
- Add `import "server-only"` at the top of the file (ignore this rule for page.tsx files) if it's only intended to be used on the server.
- When you have to add a global type, add it to `custom-env.d.ts` instead of `cloudflare-env.d.ts`, because otherwise it will be overridden by `pnpm run cf-typegen`;

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize for light and dark mode.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
